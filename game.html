      Recycle Dude Game
    </h2>
    <p>
      Green Team has created an online game intending to reach wide audiences to
      spread the message. Landfills present long-term threats to groundwater,
      surface water, and, most of all, our earth. Unfortunately, it involves a
      combination of indirect factors that make it hard for people to get
      motivated to avoid the threats. We believe we could change it by
      addressing the importance of it in small things like our game. This game
      would be like a Mario but in a green version addressing the importance of
      the 3 Râ€™s (recycle, reuse, and reduce). The player will be collecting
      waste and will be reminded of recycling. Even if a child skips a chapter
      of the landfilling in the school, it will be one of the thousands of
      attempts to remind them of its importance.
